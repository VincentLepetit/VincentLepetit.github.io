I am a director of research at ENPC ParisTech, France. I also supervize a research group at TU Graz, Austria. Before that, I was a full professor at the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision, Graz University of Technology, and before that, a senior researcher at CVLab, EPFL, Switzerland.


My research focuses on 3D scene understanding. More exactly, I aim at reducing as much as possible the guidance a system needs to learn new 3D objects and new 3D environments: How can we remove the need for training data for each new 3D problem? Currently, even self-supervised methods often require CAD models, which are not necessarily available for any type of object. This question has both theoretical implications and practical applications, as the need for training data, even synthetic, is often a deal breaker for non-academic problems.


### News

I willl be an Area Chair for CVPR 2022

4 papers accepted at CVPR 2021. Check out our papers on extending MCTS to auto-labelling for 3D scene understanding and on Neural reprojection error for merging feature learning and camera pose estimation.

1 paper accepted at ACCV 2020, on 3D object pose estimation without training.

With my co-authors, I received the Koenderick 'test of time' award at ECCV 2020 for BRIEF! - I am very grateful to the awards committee.
